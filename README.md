# CS223Project

This final project is for demostrating my proffeicent skills in the fundamentals of Python. I have decided to design a simple platformer that helps me understand GUI much better as im already proficient in CLI.

## Key Concepts:
Playing PLATFORMER is quite simple and follows a lot of the same concepts as the classics such as Super Mario Bros. and Megaman. The key concepts of this game are:
- Simple yet informative directions
- Colorful but clean design
- Simple but engaging objectives
- Static & dynamic obstacles
- Achivements that are stored in the session
- Intuitive controls that follow the industry standard

## Controls
PLATFORMER follows a simple and intuitive control schema. The arrow cluster and WASD are the primary controls.
