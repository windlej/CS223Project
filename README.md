# CS223Project

This final project is for demonstrating my proffeicent skills in the fundamentals of Python. I have decided to design a simple platformer that helps me understand GUI much better as im already proficient in CLI.

## Key Concepts:
Playing PLATFORMER is quite simple and follows a lot of the same concepts as the classics such as Super Mario Bros. and Megaman. The key concepts of this game are:
- Simple yet informative directions
- Colorful but clean design
- Simple but engaging objectives
- Static & dynamic obstacles
- Achivements that are stored in the session
- Intuitive controls that follow the industry standard

## Assests
All asessets used in this project open source and listed below.
- [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/)

## Dependecies
Once you have downloaded the zip file take note of what directory its in. Then To run the following command below from the command prompt while being in the directory. For example you will start in C:\Users\*insert username*\ adn you will want to "cd"(change directory) into games directory. So run the two commands below in that order.

`cd PLATFORMER`

`pip install -e .`

## Starting the game:
Starting the game is quite simple. In the command prompt make sure you are in the games directory then run the following command.

`python -m platformer`

## Controls:
PLATFORMER follows a simple and intuitive control schema. The arrow cluster and WASD are the primary controls.
